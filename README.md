# Probability and Applied Statistics Final Project
## Below is a breakdown of what is covered in this final project:

### Plotter, Salter Smoother:
Part one of the project was to create a program that plotted points given a set function, salt said data, and then smooth it. All data would be then exported to a .CSV file.
Then, MatLab/Octave was introduced to do the same but simpler due to built-in functions.
Finally, JFreeChart and Apache were imported to create a detailed version of the first part of the PSS project, but now java could fully display the data using the external library.

### Statistical Report:
A statistical analysis was created using a given data set found online, and each section of the textbook covered in class was to be covered in the report.
This is the data set/are the data figures used in the report: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E5dbgEWpmbHYqhBtgn30YX_1h-OZkLvksqM_-9PBP4U/edit?tab=t.0

### Dummy HashMap:
During class, we were tasked with creating our own HashMap, and were to design a simple experiment using said class, whether it be the speed of said function or another analysis.
